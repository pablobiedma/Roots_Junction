# Roots: From Farm to Fork

## Introduction
Our platform tackles the silent epidemic of food waste, particularly within the high-pressure environment of restaurants. The luxury of inefficiency is unaffordable. 

## The Problem
A staggering 18% of fresh food purchased by restaurants is wasted due to inefficient ordering practices. This not only represents a significant financial loss but also contributes to a larger environmental crisis.
